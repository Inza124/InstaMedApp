## Inspiration
C # is definitely the language that appealed to me the most. When I got a choice of technology in which I would like to pass the subject, the choice was simple. Because when I started to write this application I already knew C # language quite well, I decided to write a more ambitious project than a standard blog. After some reflection, I decided on a clinic management system and I can honestly say that this project encouraged me to continue learning programming on the .NET platform
